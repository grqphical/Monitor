# Monitor - A simple CLI Website monitoring tool

I made this as an easier way to monitor websites as I could use this in a terminal rather than a website/application


## How to use

### Installation - Compiling to EXE

Use this method if you want to have monitor as an EXE rather than a .py file

1. run ```python build.py```
2. the exe will be in ```dist/```

### Usage
If you chose not to make monitor an exe you can just run it as a normal py file with ```python monitor.py```

Add websites with ```monitor add SITE METHOD```

Remove sites with ```monitor remove SITE```

Check website's status with ```monitor status```
